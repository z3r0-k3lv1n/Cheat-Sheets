# Dewey Decimal System Cheat Sheet

The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system is a classification system used to organise and locate books in libraries. Developed by Melvil Dewey in 1876, it categorises books into ten primary classes, each of which is further divided into ten divisions, which are in turn divided into ten sections.
