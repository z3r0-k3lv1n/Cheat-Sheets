- `6` Applied Sciences
- `7` Arts and Recreation
- `8` Linguistics and Literature
- `9` Geography and History

### Subclasses

Subclasses are represented by numbers following the main class, separated by a dash.

- `51` Mathematics
- `510` Pure Mathematics
- `511` Arithmetic
- `512` Algebra

## Special Symbols

### Colon `:`

- `61/616` Medical sciences

### Plus `+`

- `51+52` Mathematics and Mechanics

### Double Quotes `"`
