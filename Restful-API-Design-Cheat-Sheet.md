# RESTful API Design Cheat Sheet

## General Guidelines
- Use nouns for resource naming (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).
- Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.
- Keep URLs simple, descriptive, and consistent.
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens for URLs (e.g., `/user-profiles`).

## URL Structure
- Use versioning in URLs (e.g., `/v1/users`).
- Group related resources under a common base URL (e.g., `/api/users`).
- Keep URLs shallow (e.g., `/users/{id}/orders` instead of `/users/{id}/details/orders`).

## HTTP Methods
- Use GET for fetching resources.
- Use POST for creating resources.
- Use PUT for updating resources (full updates).
- Use PATCH for partial updates.
- Use DELETE for removing resources.

## Request and Response
- Use meaningful HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
- Utilize JSON for request and response bodies.
- Provide pagination for large collections using query parameters (e.g., `/users?page=1&limit=10`).
- Include hyperlinks (HATEOAS) to related resources for navigation.

## Query Parameters
- Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, and searching (e.g., `/products?category=electronics&sort=price`).
- Limit the number of query parameters to keep URLs readable.

## Error Handling
- Return consistent error responses in JSON format.
- Include an error code, message, and optional details in the response.
- Provide clear guidance on handling errors in the API documentation.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for authentication.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.
- Clearly define the required authentication and permissions for each endpoint.

## Security
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted over the network.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- Utilize rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Versioning
- Include the version number in the URL (e.g., `/v1/users`).
- Handle version changes gracefully to maintain backward compatibility.

## Documentation
- Create comprehensive API documentation with clear usage instructions.
- Provide examples for different endpoints and use cases.
- Use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to automate documentation generation.

## Testing
- Write unit tests and integration tests for your API endpoints.
- Include edge cases and error scenarios in your test suite.

## Performance
- Optimize API responses for speed by using proper indexing and caching mechanisms.
- Consider implementing response compression for larger payloads.

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement logging and monitoring to track API usage, errors, and performance.
- Use analytics tools to gain insights into user behavior and API usage patterns.

## Communication
- Maintain open communication channels with API consumers for feedback and improvements.
- Notify consumers about upcoming changes and deprecations in advance.
