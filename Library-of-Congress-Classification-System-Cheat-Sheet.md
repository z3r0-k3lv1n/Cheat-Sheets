# Library of Congress Classification (LCC) System Cheat Sheet

## Overview

- **Purpose**: To organise and categorise library holdings.
- **Structure**: Alphabetic and numeric, hierarchical.
- **Used By**: Primarily academic and research libraries, and some large public libraries.

## Basic Structure

- **Main Classes**: Single alphabetic character (e.g., `Q` for Science)
- **Subclasses**: Two or more alphabetic characters (e.g., `QA` for Mathematics)
- **Topic Numbers**: Numerals for more specific topics within subclass (e.g., `76.73` for computer programming languages)
- **Book Number**: Further extension after a decimal point for even more specificity (e.g., `.J38` for Java programming language)

### Full Example: `QA76.73.J38`

- `Q`: Science
- `QA`: Mathematics
- `76.73`: Computer programming languages
- `.J38`: Java programming language

## Main Classes (Sample)

## How to Use

1. **Identify Subject**: Start by identifying the general subject area of your search.
2. **Locate Main Class and Subclass**: Use the main class and subclass to further narrow down the subject.
3. **Topic Number**: Use the numeral designations for topic specificity.
4. **Book Number**: Apply the book number for ultimate specificity, often referring to individual works or authors.
5. **Consult Catalogue**: Utilise a library’s online or physical catalogue to locate the resource.
6. **Navigate Shelves**: Once you have the full LCC number, locate the item on the library shelves.

## Tips

- **Dewey Decimal System**: Some libraries use the Dewey Decimal System instead of or alongside LCC. Ensure you know which system your library uses.
- **Online Resources**: Online catalogues can help you find the LCC number of a book or resource easily.
- **Inter-Library Loans**: If your library doesn’t have a specific resource, you can often request it from another library using its LCC number.
- **Library Staff**: When in doubt, consult the library staff who are trained in the use of the LCC system and can assist you.
